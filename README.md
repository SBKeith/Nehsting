# Nehsting

Nehsting is a simple Nest thermostat iOS application, designed to allow the following user interactions:
- Setting temperature
- Setting home/away status
- Logging in / out of personal Nest thermostat
- Viewing if current temperature set is saving money and energy (leaf icon appears)
- Turning the system to COOL / HEAT / OFF

These are all basic functionalities, but that's the point.  The focus is to see a big clean number displayed, which is controlled by a simple finger drag.  There is very little data that should be shown on the main screen; the less, the better.
