# Nehsting

Nehsting is a simple Nest thermostat iOS application, designed to allow the following user interactions:
* Setting temperature; provide visual display of adjusting gradient as the user drags finger on screen.
* Setting home/away status
* Logging in / out of personal Nest thermostat
* Viewing if current temperature set is saving money and energy (leaf icon appears)
* Turning the system to COOL / HEAT / OFF
* Saving the most recent user interaction to coredate
* Provide the user with a fun and simple way to interact with ther Nest device.
* Added ability to toggle ON/OFF temperature changing buttons (next to main button at bottom center)

These are all basic functionalities, but that's the point.  The focus is to see a big clean number displayed, which is controlled by a simple finger drag (and set when the finger is lifted).
